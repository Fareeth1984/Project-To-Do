# Projects-to-do
List of projects
1) Tracsys upgradation to Web using ASP.net MVC
2) Modules : Tracking SOP checklist for each order
3) Modules : BOM, Sample Development Module
4) T&A for Discern Project Management
5) We should think of some way to generate quotes for customers faster
The requirement from Amrendra and team is to be able to make ppts and send offers

So lets say we have all the product information saved in some system like Asset Tiger or Tracsys 
Then a merchandiser would type in / scan whatever design numbers he needs and generates a list
Then the system would give the output of 1 product per slide or 2 products or 3 products per slide (different buying agencies have different requirements) 
and the image, product details and price would get populated.
We could also generate an excel costing and price sheet of the same. 

If this can work then it could save a lot of time and manual effort that currently is going into making and sending presentations.
